# Training

A collection of expert-led training videos on C++ development, produced by Adobe's top engineers

## Adobe Software Technology Lab's Better Code Seminar

The Better Code Seminar is an interactive and informative event designed to
enhance your programming skills and elevate the quality of your code. Our goal
is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the principles that
underlie great code, based on the latest research and deep thinking in the
field.

### Better Code: Algorithms

A function is a fundamental building block in software development and a key
tool for designing efficient and maintainable systems. This talk looks at the
characteristics of a “good” function and provides practical guidance on when and
how to refactor and utilize existing libraries to develop Better Code.

### Better Code: Contracts

Does it sometimes feel like all computer systems are held together with duct
tape and good intentions? Do you have confidence that the code you write, and
the changes you make, are correct? What does “correct” even mean? How do we know
the code we write today won’t become a long-term liability? These persistent
questions can be enough to suck all the fun out of programming, but it doesn’t
have to be that way.  In this talk, we’ll look at the connective tissue of good
code, and show how to keep it strong and supple.  We’ll suggest replacing code
reviews with something better and chart the path to a more hopeful future of
software.
