First, these features will be contentious within\nWG21, which has shown reluctance to prioritize addressing C++'s memory safety\nproblems. Second, it remains unclear whether these features are sufficient to\nmake C++ a memory-safe language. Finally, C++'s complexity exacerbates the\ndifficulty of solving this problem, and the refusal to abandon backwards\ncompatibility with non-safe C++ makes the task even more challenging.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`References`}</em>{`:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2023/p2759r0.pdf\"\n        }}>{`DG Opinion on Safety for ISO\nC++`}</a>{`\nshowcases a safety direction suggested the WG21 Direction Group.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2687r0.pdf\"\n        }}>{`Design Alternatives for Type-and-Resource Safe\nC++`}</a>{`\nintroduces the idea of safety profiles.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1179r1.pdf\"\n        }}>{`Lifetime safety: Preventing common\ndangling`}</a>{`\nproposes a lifetime annotation mechanism for C++.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"notable-alternatives-considered\"\n    }}>{`Notable alternatives considered`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We examined several languages that have been proposed as safe C++ replacements\nbut ultimately fell short of our requirements.
